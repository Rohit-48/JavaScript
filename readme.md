# The while loop
A while loop lets you repeat code while a certain condition is true.

### Example
Here’s a sample program written with a while loop.

```
let number;
for (number = 1; number <= 5; number++) {
  console.log(number);
}
```

# How it works
Here’s the for loop syntax.

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; final expression) {
  // code to run while the condition is true
}
```

This is a little more complicated than the while loop syntax:

- Initialization only happens once, when the code first kicks off. It’s often used to set the initial value of the variable associated to the loop condition.
- The condition is evaluated once before the loop runs each time. If it’s true, the code runs. If not, the code doesn’t run.
- The final expression is evaluated after the loop runs each time. It’s often used to update the value of the variable associated with the loop condition, as we saw in the previous example.

# The loop counter
The variable used during initialization, condition, and the final expression of a loop is called a counter. This counter can be declared in the loop initialization to limit its scope to the loop body.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // OK
}
console.log(i); // Error: the i variable is not visible here
```

### Output
```
/usercode/index.js:4
console.log(i); // Error: the i variable is not visible here
            ^

# Infinite while loop 
The main risk with while loops is producing an infinite loop, meaning the condition is always true, and the code runs forever. This will crash your program! For example, let’s say you forget a code line that increments the number variable.

```javascript
let number = 1;
while (number <= 5) {
  console.log(number);
  // The number variable is never updated: the loop condition stays true forever
}
```

To protect yourself from infinite loops, you have to ensure the loop condition will eventually become false.

# Manipulating a for loop counter
Imagine that you accidentally modify the loop counter in the loop body, just like in the following example.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  i++; // The i variable is updated in the loop body
}
```

Each time the loop runs, the counter variable is incremented twice: once in the body and once in the final expression after the loop runs. When you’re using a for loop, you’ll almost always want to omit anything to do with the counter inside the body of your loop. Just leave it in that first line!

# Discussion
For loops are great because they include the notion of counting by default, avoiding the problem of infinite loops. However, it means you have to know how many times you want the loop to run as soon as you write your code. For situations where you don’t already know how many times the code should run, while loops make sense.

# while loop example
Here’s a while loop use case in which a random number from 0 - 9 is given. The loop keeps incrementing the number until it reaches 10 and then terminates.

```javascript
let number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);

while (number !== 10) {
  console.log(++number);
}
```

### Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

# The do-while loop
The do-while loop is a variation of the while loop. It’s used when you want to run the loop at least once, no matter what.

Here’s the syntax.

```javascript
do {
  // code to run at least once
} while (condition);
```

The loop body is executed once before the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed again, and so on. If the condition is false, the loop stops.

# Example
Here’s an example of a do-while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5.

```javascript
let number = 1;

do {
  console.log(number);
  number++;
} while (number <= 5);
```

### Output
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

# Summary
- A for loop is used when you know how many times the code should run.
- A while loop is used when you’re not sure how many times the code should run.
- The do-while loop is used when you want the code to run at least once.
- Be careful to avoid infinite loops.

# Challenge
1. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
3. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a do-while loop.
4. Write a program that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a for loop.
5. Write a program that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.
6. Write a program that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a do-while loop.
7. Write a program that prints only the even numbers between 1 and 10 using a for loop.
8. Write a program that prints only the even numbers between 1 and 10 using a while loop.
9. Write a program that prints only the even numbers between 1 and 10 using a do-while loop.
10. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, but stops after 5 using a for loop. You can’t know how many increments it’ll take for the number to equal to 10, so while is generally good for loops that depend on external conditions.

Ultimately, choosing which loop to use depends on the context. All loops can be written with a while loop, but if you know how many times you want the loop to run, for is the best choice.
